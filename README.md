# GeneticEvolution

## Goal
### This Project is an experiment into genetic algorithms

At the moment the goal is a playingfield with individual creatures who eat, mate and attack, whose behaviour is defined by a binary encoded genome which can be inherited and mutated in a similar manner to real life mutation

In the future there are many options and paths this project can take but for now even the current scope is pretty large
